# Add Org Members Using the Cockpit

Add users as org members and assign roles to grant the users access to information, such as user and quota information in a Cloud Foundry org.



## Prerequisites

-   You have the Org Manager role for the org in question.

    > ### Note:  
    > When you create an org, you have the Org Manager role in that org.

    > ### Note 2:
    > Subaccount admins, can get the Org Manager role, by following this KBA [3249765](https://me.sap.com/notes/3249765)

    For more information, see [About Roles in the Cloud Foundry Environment](about-roles-in-the-cloud-foundry-environment-0907638.md).

-   The users exist in a trusted platform identity provider.

    For more information, see [About User Management in the Cloud Foundry Environment](about-user-management-in-the-cloud-foundry-environment-8e6ce96.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to your subaccount. Make sure that Cloud Foundry is enabled. For more information, see [Navigate to Orgs and Spaces](navigate-to-orgs-and-spaces-5bf8735.md).

2.  In the navigation area, choose *Cloud Foundry* \> *Org Members*.

    The screen displays all members currently assigned to the org in a list.

3.  Choose *Add Members*.

4.  Enter one or more e-mail addresses.

    Use commas \(`,`\), spaces \(``\), semicolons \(`;`\), or line breaks to separate members.

5.  Enter the *Origin* for the identity provider, which hosts the members you just added.

    The default identity provider is ***sap.ids***.

    For more information, see [Default Identity Provider](default-identity-provider-d6a8db7.md).

    If the new members are platform users from a custom identity provider, enter the origin.

    -   Feature Set A: Choose *Other* and then enter the corresponding origin of the Identity Authentication tenant.

        For more information about finding the origin, see [Establish Trust and Federation of Custom Identity Providers for Platform Users in Multi-Environment Subaccounts \[Feature Set A\]](establish-trust-and-federation-of-custom-identity-providers-for-platform-users-in-multi-8600afb.md).

    -   Feature Set B: Select the corresponding origin of the Identity Authentication tenant.

        For more information about finding the origin, see [Establish Trust and Federation of Custom Identity Providers for Platform Users \[Feature Set B\]](establish-trust-and-federation-of-custom-identity-providers-for-platform-users-feature-c368984.md).


6.  Select roles for the members and save your entries.

    For more information, see [About Roles in the Cloud Foundry Environment](about-roles-in-the-cloud-foundry-environment-0907638.md).

## Next Steps

-   To select or unselect roles for a member, choose :pencil2:. The changes you make to the roles of a member take effect immediately.
-   To remove all the roles of a member, choose :wastebasket:. This action removes the member from the organization and any spaces in the org.
-   If the users need to view or manage applications in spaces, add the users to the relevant spaces, too.
